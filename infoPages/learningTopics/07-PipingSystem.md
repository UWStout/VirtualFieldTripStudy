The underground piping network system distributes steam and chilled water generated from the Plant to
buildings around the campus to serve their heating and cooling needs. Underground systems are used
because of aesthetics and safety issues. They are closed-loop systems. That means that steam is
generated at the Plant, sent via underground pipes to the buildings to be used, then the steam is
condensed back to water which is then pumped back to the Plant to be reused. This network also includes
the underground piping system that collects warmed water after chilled water has been used at the
buildings. The steam piping system is about 5 miles in length and serves 51 buildings of the whole
campus, while the chilled water piping system is about two miles long and serves 20 buildings, mainly
at the South Campus.

Except at several buildings where the old steam and condensate pipes installed in 1916 still have
insulation with asbestos and are directly buried underground, significant parts of the steam and
condensate system use pre-insulated cast iron pipes running in concrete surface trenches or deep-buried
small tunnels. Steam pipe sizes vary from 2.5 to 10 inches, and condensate pipes employ smaller sizes
ranging from 1.5 to 5 inches. Heat transfer in buried systems is influenced by the thermal conductivity
of the soil and by the depth of burial, particularly when the system's thermal insulation has a low
thermal resistance. All directly buried underground chilled water piping systems use 4-inch to 18-inch
diameter HDPE pipes and can handle working pressure up to 350 PSIG.
