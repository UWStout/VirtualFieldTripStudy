## Site Navigation
Right now on the virtual tour site, there are four sections for your to explore and you
are currently in the first section. Each of the following sections will cover a
thermodynamic concept or piece of equipment in use in the heating and chiller plant.

Each section will include the following parts:
<dl>
  <dt>Background Information</dt>
  <dd><p>A short introduction to the thermodynamics concepts or equipment in that section</p></dd>

  <dt>Interactive Virtual Tour</dt>
  <dd><p>Click the next button to start the tour for that section. Navigate around and click on
  the information hot-spot buttons (a green circle with an exclamation point) within the tour to
  view their content. When you are done, click the 'X' button in the upper-right to exit the
  virtual tour and return to the previous page.</p></dd>
</dl>

After you complete all the sections (including their virtual tours) there is a separate page with
some short quizzes at the end of the page which will attempt to assess how well the information was
communicated in the virtual tour. Visit the [assessment page]({{ "infoPages/04-Assessments.html" | absolute_url }}")
and Click the buttons to open the quiz and submit your answers. Note that some of the quizzes may
have a time-limit.

## This is a Preview
Only the first floor of the building is available right now with access to the basement,
the catwalk scaffolding and even the roof coming later to help you appreciate the full
extent of this energy efficient facility at use right here on our campus. You can feel
free to spend some time in the tour before proceeding to the first thermodynamic topic
in this educational journey.
