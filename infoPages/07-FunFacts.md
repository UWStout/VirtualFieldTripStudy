## (Fun) Facts about Thermodynamics, Heating Plant
Below are a collection of interesting facts and answers to questions about the central heating plant and
thermodynamics in general.

### WHAT IS THE TALLEST STRUCTURE IN MENOMONIE, WISCONSIN?
At 240 feet and 4-inch height, the red chimney of Stout’s heating plant is one of the tallest structures
in Menomonie. The chimney was erected in 1965 by Consolidated Chimney Company, Chicago, Illinois using
almost 90,000 red octagon and face bricks. A chimney is a structure for venting hot flue gas from the
boiler to the outside atmosphere at a suitable height to ensure the pollutants are dispersed over a wider
area to meet legislation and safety requirements. Its height is determined primarily by environmental
protection agencies permitting ground-level concentration limits. It usually is cylindrical in
construction and exposed to harsh environments inside and outside. With its abrasive and corrosive
characteristics, flue gas can damage structural materials. For this, the chimney is built of brick.

### HOW LONG IS THE UNDERGROUND HEATING AND COOLING PIPING SYSTEM AT UW STOUT?
Seven miles or about 37,000 feet.

The underground piping network system distributes steam and chilled water generated from the Plant to
buildings around the campus to serve their heating and cooling needs. This network also includes the
underground piping system that collects condensate and warmed water, after steam and chilled water have
been used at the buildings.

### WHAT IS THERMODYNAMICS?
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat and other forms
of energy. It describes how thermal energy is converted to and from other forms of energy and how thermal
energy affects matter. The name thermodynamics itself is an example of a Greek technical term. Basically,
it means the process of converting heat (thermo) into mechanical power (dynamics). Modern thermodynamics
deals with more than just thermal energy.

### WHAT IS A “TON” OF REFRIGERATION?
A ton of refrigeration or air conditioning is the amount of heat that must be removed from 1 ton (2000 lbm)
of water in one day (24 hours) to freeze it at 32°F degrees Fahrenheit at 1 atmosphere pressure. It is
also the amount of heat absorbed by the melting of 1 ton of ice in 24 hours at 32°F at atmospheric pressure.
Using more conventional units, 1 ton of refrigeration equals 12000 Btu/hr.

### HOW CAN AN ENGINE RUN BACKWARD?
To get an engine to run backward, you need to put work into it where the work typically comes out. If the
engine has an output shaft, you attach a motor or something to the shaft to turn it so that you are putting
work into the engine instead of having it produce work. A heat engine converts some heat from a high-temperature
source into work and rejects the remaining heat to a low-temperature sink. A “backward-running” heat engine
draws heat from a low-temperature source, adds work energy to it, and rejects everything to a high-temperature
sink.

### IS IT CALLED AN ICEBOX OR A REFRIGERATOR?
An icebox was a wooden box containing ice and food to be preserved. It is a compact non-mechanical refrigerator
and was a common early-twentieth-century kitchen appliance before the development of safely powered refrigeration
devices.

Originally, the ice was put on the bottom and the food on the top. But eventually, it was realized that this was inefficient because cold air is heavier than warm air. Thereafter, the ice was put on the top of the icebox, and
the food was always placed below it so that the heavier cold air could circulate around the food. The icebox was
invented in 1803 and manufactured in the United States until 1953. Ice needed to be added every day or two in the
original iceboxes. But, by 1923, improved thermal insulation design required ice to be added only every five to
seven days.

The term refrigerator is reserved for a device that does not use ice to produce cold temperatures, even though the
device may be used to preserve food. There are vapor-compression refrigerators, gas expansion refrigerators,
thermoelectric refrigerators, and so forth.

### WHO INVENTED THE “OTTO” CYCLE?
Unknown to Nikolaus Otto (1832-1891), the four-stroke cycle internal combustion engine had already been patented
in the 1860s by the French engineer Alphonse Eugene Beau de Rochas (1815–1893). However, Rochas did not actually
build and test the engine he patented. Since Otto was the first to actually construct and operate the engine, the
cycle is named after him rather than Rochas.

### HOW DANGEROUS ARE BOILER EXPLOSIONS?
Between 1898 and 1902, there were 1600 boiler explosions in the United States, in which 1184 people were killed.
On March 10, 1905, a boiler explosion in a shoe factory in Brockton, Massachusetts, killed 58 people and injured
an additional 117 people. On December 6, 1906, a similar explosion occurred in a shoe factory in Lynn, Massachusetts.
As a result of the ensuing public outcry, the state of Massachusetts enacted the first legal code of rules for the
construction of steam boilers, in 1907.

From 1908 to 1910, Ohio and various other states enacted similar legislation, but because no two states had exactly
the same code, boiler manufacturers had great difficulty satisfying all the varying and occasionally conflicting rules.

In 1911, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) joined with the boiler manufacturers to formulate a set
of uniform standards for the design and construction of safe boilers. The first edition of the resulting ASME Boiler
and Pressure Vessel Code was produced in 1914, and by the 1930s, many advancements in boiler technology had been made.
An updated and modernized version of this code is used throughout the industry today.

### HOW MANY LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS ARE THERE?
There are four basic laws of thermodynamics: the zeroth, first, second, and third laws. Like all of the other basic
laws of physics, each of these laws is a generalization of observed events in the real world, and their “discovery”
was the result of an individual’s perception of how nature functions. Curiously, the order in which the thermodynamic
laws are named does not correspond to the order of their discovery. The zeroth law is attributed to Fowler and
Guggenheim in 1939; the first law to Joule, Mayer, and Colding in about 1845; the second law to Carnot in 1824; and
the third law to Nerst in 1907. The first and second laws are the most pragmatic and consequently the most important
to engineers. A thermodynamic analysis involves applying the laws of thermodynamics to a thermodynamic system. A
thermodynamic system is a volume of space containing the item chosen for thermodynamic analysis.

### THE ZEROTH LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
The zeroth law was one of the last thermodynamic laws to be developed. It was introduced by R. H. Fowler and E. A.
Guggenheim in 1939.

One of the major values of the zeroth law is that it forms the theoretical basis for temperature measurement
technology. Consider the mercury in glass thermometer shown in Figure. The zeroth law tells us that if the glass is
at the same temperature as (i.e., is in thermal equilibrium with) the surrounding fluid, and if the mercury is at
the same temperature as the glass, then the mercury is at the same temperature as the surrounding fluid. Thus, the
thermometer can be graduated to show the mercury temperature, which is automatically equal to the temperature of
its surroundings.

### WHY IS IT CALLED ENTHALPY?
The quantity u + pv has had many different names over the years. In the early years of thermodynamics, it was known
at various times as the heat function, the heat content, and the total heat. The term enthalpy comes from the Greek
meaning “in warmth,” and was introduced in 1922 by Professor Alfred W. Porter. He credited the coining of the name
to the Dutch physicist Kamerlingh Onnes (1853–1926). This name was officially adopted by the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1936.

### WHY USE F AND G SUBSCRIPTS?
The use of f and g as subscripts here is out of tradition. They come from the first letters of the German words
flussig (for liquid) and gas. More appropriate English subscripts might be l for liquid and v for vapor, but they
are not used.

### WHY DO THEY CALL IT QUALITY?
In the 19th century, there were a lot of steam engines. Railroads, factories, ships, and so on all used steam engines as their source of power. The people responsible for keeping these engines running noticed that they worked better if the steam contained more vapor than liquid. So, a mixture containing a lot of vapor and little liquid was said to be high quality. They defined this quality as the ratio of vapor's mass to total mass of liquid plus vapor. On the other hand, the amount of liquid present in a mixture is called the moisture of the mixture.

The condition where the quality x = 1.0 is reserved for saturated vapor and does not apply to superheated vapor. Similarly, the condition where quality x = 0 is reserved for saturated liquid and does not apply to compressed liquid. Note that the quality x of a liquid-vapor mixture can never be less than 0 or greater than 1.0.

### WHAT ARE HEAT AND WORK ANYWAY?
Heat is usually defined as energy transport to or from a system due to a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. This can occur by only three modes: conduction, convection, and radiation.

Work is more difficult to define. It is often defined as a force moving through a distance, but this is only one type of work. There are many other work modes as well. Since the only energy transport modes for moving energy across a system’s

boundary are heat, mass flow, and work, the simplest definition of work is that it is any energy transport mode that is neither heat nor mass flow.

### ENERGY TRANSPORT MECHANISMS
There are three energy transport mechanisms, any or all of which may be operating in any given system: (1) heat, (2) work, and (3) mass flow. These three mechanisms and their sign conventions are illustrated in Figure. Note that the sign conventions for heat and work shown in the Figure are not the same. Heat transfer into a system is taken as positive, whereas work must be produced by or come out of a system to be positive. This is the conventional mechanical engineering sign convention and reflects the traditional view that heat coming out of a system is “lost” (i.e., negative), while work produced by a system (such as an engine) should be assigned a positive value. By definition, a closed system has no mass crossing its system boundary, so it can experience only work and heat transport mechanisms.
