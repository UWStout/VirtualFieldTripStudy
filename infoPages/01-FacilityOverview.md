The campus of the University of Wisconsin Stout utilizes a central heating and chiller
facility to provide heating and cooling throughout its buildings. Industrial grade
boilers and chillers employ the fundamental principles of thermodynamics to add or
remove thermal energy to or from water. The water carries that energy through insulated
underground pipes to buildings where it used for a number of tasks (primarily heating and
air conditioning).

You've probably noticed the heating and chiller plant before due to the large brick
chimney utilized by the boilers; it's the tallest structure in the town, even taller
than the iconic clock tower! This project will take you inside the central plant on a
virtual tour that is enhanced with key information about the thermodynamic processes
that are active every day in the building.

Below is an opportunity to freely explore the first floor of the plant without this extra
educational material so that you can orient yourself to the interface and overall layout
of the building.
