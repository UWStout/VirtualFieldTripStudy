1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,380
A thermodynamic cycle is a sequence of processes
that begins and ends at the same state.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,750
A
system has completed a thermodynamic cycle

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,269
when the system undergoes a series of processes
and then returns to its original state, so

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,860
that the properties of the system at the end
of the cycle

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,680
are the same as at its beginning.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,960
For example, refrigerant circulating through
a chiller executes

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
a cycle.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,820
A vapor compression refrigeration cycle typically
has four processes.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,079
Process 1 to 2 is the Isentropic compression
in a compressor.

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,660
Process 2 to 3 is the Constant-pressure
heat rejection in a condenser.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,000
Process 3 to 4 is the throttling in an
expansive device.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,309
Process 4 to 1 is the Constant-pressure
heat absorption in an evaporator

13
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,020
When a heat engine is run thermodynamically
backward, it becomes a heat

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,560
pump, a refrigerator, or an air conditioner,
depending on your point of view.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,000
When a heat engine runs backward (or in reverse),
it receives a net input of work

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,120
W that causes an amount of heat QL to be removed
from a low-temperature

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,610
region and an amount of heat QH to be added
to a high-temperature region.

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,330
So, it
actually cools the low-temperature region

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,960
and heats the high-temperature region.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,180
A backward-running heat engine is a refrigeration
machine, but its technical name

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,540
depends on exactly how it is being used.

22
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,890
For example, if food occupies the lowtemperature
region, then the device is indeed called a

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,280
refrigerator, but if people
occupy the low-temperature region, then the

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,900
device is called an air conditioner.

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,290
On the other hand, if people occupy the high-temperature
region and utilize QH

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,760
for space-heating purposes, then the device
is called a heat pump.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,250
Though the
details of their design and operation differ

28
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,350
slightly, refrigerators, air conditioners,
and heat pumps can all be modeled as backward-running

29
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,370
heat engines.

30
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,960
The distinctions between a refrigerator and
a heat pump are shown in the next

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,390
figure.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,098
A heat pump is a thermodynamic system operating
in a thermodynamic cycle that

33
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,660
removes heat from a low-temperature body and
delivers heat to a high

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,819
temperature body.

35
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,480
To accomplish this energy transfer, the heat
pump receives

36
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,819
external energy in the form of work or heat
from the surroundings.

37
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,980
While the name “heat pump” is the thermodynamic
term used to describe a cyclic

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,300
device that allows the transfer of heat energy
from a low temperature to a higher

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,000
temperature, we use the terms “refrigerator”
and “heat pump” to apply to

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,830
particular devices.

41
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,099
Here a refrigerator is a device that operates
on a thermodynamic

42
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,209
cycle and extracts heat from a low-temperature
medium.

43
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,930
The heat pump also
operates on a thermodynamic cycle but rejects

44
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,640
heat to the high-temperature
medium.

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,269
The efficiency of a refrigerator or heat pump
is expressed in terms of the

46
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:00,400
coefficient of performance, or COP.

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,580
For the refrigerator the desired result is
the heat supplied at the low temperature

48
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,550
and the input is the net work into the device
to make the cycle operate.

49
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,739
The
performance of refrigeration cycles can be

50
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,640
described as the ratio of the amount of
energy received by the system from the low-temperature

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,610
medium, QL, to the net
work into the system to accomplish this effect,

52
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,250
Wnet, in.

53
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,909
For the heat pump acting like a refrigerator
or an air conditioner, the primary

54
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,110
function of the device is the transfer of
heat from the low- temperature system.

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,549
The performance of heat pumps can be described
as the ratio of the amount of

56
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,769
energy discharged from the system to the high-temperature
medium, QH, to the

57
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,659
net work into the system to accomplish this
effect, Wnet, in.

58
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:49,980
For a reversible cycle, a reversed Carnot
cycle is called a Carnot refrigerator cycle.

59
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,490
The coefficients of performance of Carnot
refrigerators and heat pumps are

60
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,390
expressed in terms of temperatures as illustrated
in the diagram below.
