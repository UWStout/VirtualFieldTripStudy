00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Here is an example of what safety valves look 
like. These safety valves are for protection.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,780
They protect the boilers and plant staff from 
a high-pressure situation. Boiler safety valves  

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,740
are installed in a pair with one valve set 
at slightly higher pressure than the other.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,400
This ensures the boiler does 
not explode if over-pressurized  

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,740
through failure of any one safety valve.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,040
The set pressure of the valves must not exceed the 
maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,160
What this means is that the safety valve 
of Boiler 4 must open at or below 120 PSIG.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,880
Installed next to the two safety valves is 
the vent valve. The valve will vent air from  

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,500
the steam drum when filling the boiler, or 
release moist steam prior to the filling.
