00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,380
Here is the highest point inside the 
heating plant on top of boiler number 4.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,060
When boiler number 4 is in service, it 
is taking water into the tubes and the  

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,760
burner will boil that water to 
make steam at a high pressure.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,500
The main stop valve is located 
on the top of the steam drum.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,700
Because the plant has four boilers connecting 
parallel to a common steam header, the second  

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,900
stop valve is required to isolate this boiler 
and its pressure from the process of the plant.
