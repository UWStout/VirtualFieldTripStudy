00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
The evaporator and condenser are shell and 
tube heat exchangers reinforced by a system of  

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,380
baffles to distribute the refrigerant gas flow 
properly for the most efficient heat transfer.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,700
A baffle is also used to prevent direct 
high-velocity impingement on the tubes.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,360
An integral sub-cooler is located 
at the bottom of the condenser shell  

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,400
providing highly effective liquid refrigerant 
subcooling for the highest cycle efficiency.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,240
The shell is covered by a layer of 
three-quarter-inch thick insulation  

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,120
to prevent heat loss or gain 
from the surrounding air.
