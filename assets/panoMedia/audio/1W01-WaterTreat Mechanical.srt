1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
Water treatment is required to maintain 
peak performance, reduce water consumption,  

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,820
and minimize corrosion, scale, and fouling 
while controlling microbial growth.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,240
Water quality is controlled by 
a combination of pretreatment  

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,280
for makeup water and chemical treatment.

5
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:20,220
Pretreatment for makeup water, sometimes 
called mechanical filtration, is used to  

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,200
remove suspended particles. Pretreatment for 
makeup water consists of the following elements:

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,540
Water softeners (for removal of 
calcium and magnesium hardness)

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,580
Reverse osmosis (which can remove up to 99% of  

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,480
minerals and dissolved solids from 
the water leaving almost pure H2O).

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,720
Reverse osmosis is a process in which reactive, 
colloidal silica, and dissolved salts can be  

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,220
removed from water by forcing the water through 
a semi-permeable membrane under high pressure.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
Contaminants that are not removed mechanically by 
pretreatment equipment must be treated chemically.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,180
Once in the feedwater, dissolved gases, hardness,  

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,960
and dissolved minerals must be treated 
to prevent deposition and corrosion.
