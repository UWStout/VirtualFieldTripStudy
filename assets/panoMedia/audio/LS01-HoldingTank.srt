00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
After providing heat to the buildings, the 
steam is sent to a condensate collection  

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,780
tank within each building, where 
the majority condenses into water.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,960
Once the building's condensate 
tank has collected enough water,  

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,980
a pump sends the water to the heating plant's 
primary holding tank below the control room.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,500
This tank holds 5,000 gallons of water and is 
the main feedwater supply to the boilers. Here,  

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,740
about 75 percent of the steam 
sent out, returns as water.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,860
At this stage, the condensate water is 
recycled, reused, and mixed with makeup  

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,240
water to feed into the system. As the water 
leaves the tank, it is pumped back up to a  

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,620
pressure of 150 psi and is sent through 
the boilers to repeat the process again.
