1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,340
Boiler 1 was a D-type water-tube boiler 
produced by English Boiler in 1953.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,640
It was installed and started 
making steam for the campus  

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,620
in 1965. It was then upgraded 
to a new larger unit in 2005.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,240
Water-tube boilers are designed 
to circulate hot combustion gases  

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,260
or flue gas around the outside of a 
large number of water-filled tubes.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,920
As the flue gas passes through 
the tubes, it heats the tubes,  

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,440
which then heat the water to produce steam.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,800
The tubes extend between an upper header, called 
a steam drum, and a lower header, called a mud  

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,860
drum or sometimes, a water drum. Tubes are either 
straight or bent into simple or complex shapes.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,660
Water-tube boilers are designed 
to circulate hot combustion gases  

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,860
or flue gas around the outside of a 
large number of water-filled tubes.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,900
As the flue gas passes through the tubes, 
it heats the tubes, which then heats the  

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,220
water. As more heat is transferred, the 
water temperature keeps rising until it  

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,740
reaches the saturation temperature and water 
changes phase from liquid to vapor or steam.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,920
Boiler 1 can produce 25,000 pounds 
of saturated steam per hour at the  

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,320
pressure of 100 psi, at a temperature 
of 338 degrees Fahrenheit. The steam  

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,740
is sent out to the buildings on campus 
through an underground piping system.
