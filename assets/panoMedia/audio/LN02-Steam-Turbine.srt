A steam turbine is a mechanical device 
that converts mechanical energy stored in 

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,940
high-pressure flowing steam into 
rotational mechanical energy. Turbines are 

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,660
commonly used in power plants to produce 
mechanical power that may be used 

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,800
by a generator to produce electrical 
power. At Stout’s heating plant, the 

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,940
mechanical energy from the turbine is 
used to run the feedwater pump, as seen 

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,560
in Figure 1. The steam turbine drives this 
feed pump to supply water to the boiler 

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,700
units as needed. The feed pump raises 
the feedwater to a pressure high enough 

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,740
to enter the boiler. Steam turbine-driven feed 
pumps are typical with high pressure water-tube  

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,780
boiler installations. The turbine is supplied with 
steam directly from the boiler and exhausts into a  

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,120
back-pressure line which can be used
for feed heating. 

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,000
A schematic of this steam turbine is shown 
in Figure 2. It consists of two sets of 

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,500
blades. The first set of blades, called 
stationary blades, are fixed on a casing., The 

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,700
second set of blades, called rotor blades, 
are fixed on the rotor.. The steam is 

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,240
directed by the stationary blades so 
that it impinges on the rotating turbine 

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,379
blades. During this process, momentum 
is transferred from the fluid, causing a 

16
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,460
torque on the rotating shaft. Stationary 
blades are used to redirect the steam 

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,540
between each set of rotating blades. 
Steam enters the turbine at high pressure 

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,620
and temperature. The pressure of steam 
decreases as it flows from the inlet to 

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,540
the outlet of the turbine. The specific 
enthalpy of the steam also decreases as it 

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,960
flows through the device since energy is 
transferred from the fluid to the rotating 

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,460
shaft. Figure 3 illustrates the typical 
symbol used to represent the turbine 

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,140
component in a cycle schematic.
