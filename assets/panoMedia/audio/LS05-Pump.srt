00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
Water pumps move chilled, condenser 
water and feedwater to and from the 

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,460
refrigeration equipment and associated 
ancillary equipment. Pumps can be 

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,060
classified into three broad categories:
(1) reciprocating, (2) rotary, and (3)  

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,000
centrifugal. Both reciprocating and rotary
pumps are positive displacement pumps. They  

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,780
discharge a fixed amount of liquid
at a given speed. The primary moving  

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,120
element of a reciprocating pump is a piston
or plunger, while a rotary pump is a rotor.  

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,380
The most frequently used pump in the
heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning  

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,880
industry is a centrifugal pump with an
enclosed impeller and a volute casing,  

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,760
as seen in Figure 1. In a centrifugal pump, an
electric motor or other power source  

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,800
rotates the impellers at the motor’s rated
speed. Impeller rotation adds energy to the  

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,220
fluid after it is directed into the center
of the rotating impeller.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,920
Centrifugal pumps provide the primary 
force to distribute and recirculate hot and 

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,000
chilled water in various space 
conditioning and plumping systems. The pump 

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,560
provides predetermined water flow to the 
space load terminal units or to a thermal 

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,760
storage chamber for release at peak load. 
At the central heating and chiller plant, 

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,000
the hydronic systems that use pumps include:
Condensing water circuits to the cooling tower. 

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,060
Chilled water pump.
Boiler feeds. 

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,140
Condensate returns as seen in Figures 2 and 3.
A boiler feed pump is a critical equipment used  

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,460
in a boiler house that supplies 
deaerated and LP-dosed feedwater  

20
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,440
to the boiler. This pump must pump feedwater
into the boiler drum against the pressure. So,  

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,860
discharged pressure of this pump is
higher than the boiler drum pressure.  

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,440
A feed pump is a multistage pump driven by
an electrical motor or turbine. Boiler feed  

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,160
and condensate return pumps for steam
boilers should be selected based on  

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,720
the boiler manufacturer’s requirements.
Centrifugal pumps can also be found in water  

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,240
treatment and service water heating
systems.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,580
Pumps, as well as compressors and fans, 
are devices that increase the pressure of 

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,180
a fluid. Work is supplied to these 
devices from an external source through a 

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,100
rotating shaft. Therefore, pumps involve 
work inputs. If we neglect the changes in 

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,240
kinetic and potential energies as fluid 
flows through a pump having one entrance 

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,980
and one exit, the steady-state, steady-flow, 
the first law, or the conservation of 

31
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,000
energy equation is presented in Figure 
4. As there is very little temperature 

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,200
change across such hydraulic pumps, the 
shaft work absorbed by pumps does not 

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,500
depend on the temperature difference 
between output and input fluids.
