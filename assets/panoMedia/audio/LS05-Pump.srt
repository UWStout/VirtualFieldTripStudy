1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Water pumps move chilled, condenser water 
and feedwater to and from the refrigeration  

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,620
equipment and associated ancillary equipment.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,680
Pumps can be classified 
into three broad categories: 

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,560
(1) reciprocating, (2) 
rotary, and (3) centrifugal.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,880
Both reciprocating and rotary pumps 
are positive displacement pumps.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,760
They discharge a fixed amount of liquid
at a given speed.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,420
The primary moving element 
of a reciprocating pump is a  

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,420
piston or plunger, while a rotary pump is a rotor.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,520
The most frequently used pump in the heating, 
ventilating, and air-conditioning industry is  

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,740
a centrifugal pump with an enclosed impeller 
and a volute casing, as seen in Figure 1.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,540
In a centrifugal pump, an electric 
motor or other power source rotates  

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,520
the impellers at the motor’s rated speed.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,600
Impeller rotation adds energy to 
the fluid after it is directed  

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
into the center of the rotating impeller.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,700
Centrifugal pumps provide the primary 
force to distribute and recirculate hot  

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,420
and chilled water in various space 
conditioning and plumping systems.

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,180
The pump provides predetermined water flow to the  

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,740
space load terminal units or to a thermal 
storage chamber for release at peak load.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,540
At the central heating and chiller plant, 
the hydronic systems that use pumps include:

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,080
Condensing water circuits to the cooling tower.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,700
Chilled water pumps.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,080
Boiler feeds.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,500
Condensate returns as seen in Figures 2 and 3.

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,300
A boiler feed pump is a critical equipment used in  

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,220
a boiler house that supplies deaerated 
and LP-dosed feedwater to the boiler.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,700
This pump must pump feedwater into 
the boiler drum against the pressure.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,780
So, discharged pressure of this pump is 
higher than the boiler drum pressure.

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,400
A feed pump is a multistage pump driven 
by an electrical motor or turbine.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Boiler feed and condensate return 
pumps for steam boilers should be  

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,940
selected based on the boiler 
manufacturer’s requirements.

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,160
Centrifugal pumps can also be found in water 
treatment and service water heating systems.

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,880
Pumps, as well as compressors and fans, are 
devices that increase the pressure of a fluid.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,840
Work is supplied to these devices from an 
external source through a rotating shaft.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,000
Therefore, pumps involve work inputs. If we 
neglect the changes in kinetic and potential  

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,860
energies as fluid flows through a pump having 
one entrance and one exit, the steady-state,  

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,200
steady-flow, the first law, or the conservation of
energy equation is presented in Figure 4.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,860
As there is very little temperature 
change across such hydraulic pumps,  

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,140
the shaft work absorbed by pumps does not 

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,440
depend on the temperature difference 
between output and input fluids.
