00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Feedwater used in the boiler should be free from 
any dissolved gases and oxygen. The deaerator is  

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,340
used for this. The main purpose of a deaerator is 
to deaerate gas, a process called degasification,  

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,079
from the feedwater. Also, it serves as a 
storage tank where feedwater is pumped into  

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,820
the boiler. It is the place where feedwater 
is preheated before entering the boiler.  

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,620
To preheat the feedwater, low-pressure 
steam is utilized. Low-pressure steam is  

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,320
also used to remove dissolved oxygen from water.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,840
The heating plant is currently using spray and  

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,720
tray-type deaerators to remove 
dissolved gases in feedwater.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,380
In this type of deaerator, water enters from 
the top. Water is distributed through a set of  

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,340
nozzles, as shown in the next figure. 
Water falls into the bottom storage  

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,360
tank from the deaerator column through 
the perforated tray and small droplets  

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,960
are formed. Low pressure steam is 
supplied to the steam distributor.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,640
This steam moves up into the deaerator column and 
comes in contact with droplets of the feedwater.  

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,020
Feedwater is heated up to the boiling point 
corresponding to the deaerator pressure.  

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,060
Due to the formation of small water 
droplets, the contact surface exposed  

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,020
to steam increases which results in 
complete removal of the dissolved gases.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,420
By heating the water, dissolving 
capacity of gases in the water decreases.

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,480
So, dissolved gases are removed from the water 
easily. These removed gases along with some  

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,620
non-condensing vapour present in the steam, 
is vented to the atmosphere through a vent.

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,600
The vent is fitted with an orifice and 
a bypass valve. The deaerated water is  

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,760
then collected in a tank called a storage tank.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,560
If there is still dissolved gas which 
is not removed at the deaerator column,  

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,700
then it is removed here due to large 
surface area of the heated water.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,640
Initially, when feedwater 
is at a normal temperature,  

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,860
heating steam is used to heat the water.
