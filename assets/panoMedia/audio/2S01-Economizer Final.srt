00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Here is the top of boiler number 
1 where the combustion product,  

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,020
or flue gases inside the boiler, are 
going to be released to the chimney.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,640
Flue gases are generally in the temperature 
range of 400 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit,  

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,720
so there is a huge amount of losses from the 
boiler if we cannot utilize this heat energy.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,260
The university has installed a heat recovery 
device called the economizer to recover some  

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,220
of the heat from the flue gases for 
heating the feed water into the boiler.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,800
An economizer is a heat exchanger device that  

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,500
preheats feed water before 
it gets fed to the boiler.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,880
Since the heat energy is given to the 
water, the requirement of fuel for  

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,320
producing steam is optimized. Because of 
that, we call this device an economizer.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,840
The Economizer works on the principle of heat 
transfer that usually takes place from high  

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,000
temperature to low temperature. As shown in the 
figure of a heat exchanger, hot flue gas enters  

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,980
on the shell side and water the on tube side with 
an extended heating surface like Fins or Gills.  

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,720
Flue gases from the boiler outlet are at 
high a temperature and feed water that  

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,580
needs to be preheated is at a low temperature.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,720
So, this temperature difference between 
the water and flue gases helps to increase  

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,040
the feed water temperature and reduce the 
heat load on the boiler to a great extent.

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,000
The economizer reduces not only consumption but 
also the overall energy costs, environmental  

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,120
impact, and carbon footprint. The economizer can 
boost system efficiency by 3% to 5% on average.
