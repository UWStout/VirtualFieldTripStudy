00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
UW Stout Library’s Mechanical Room.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,840
We are in a mechanical room on the 
sixth floor of UW Stout’s library.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,400
The key equipment in the room is the 
air handling unit, commonly called AHU.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,020
The AHU is responsible for heating and 
cooling the five-story library that  

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,140
provides seating capacity for 1,086 readers 
and space for 400,000 volumes of work.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,840
Three AHUs in this mechanical room 
can provide conditioned air to 123,000  

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,980
square feet of the library at up 
to 75000 cubic feet per minute.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,680
An AHU is a mechanical device used to regulate and 
circulate air as part of a heating, ventilating,  

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,140
and air-conditioning (HVAC) system.
 
It is usually a large metal box containing  

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,240
a blower, heating and cooling coils, filter 
racks, a mixing chamber, and dampers.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,780
Air handlers usually connect to a 
ductwork ventilation system that  

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,560
distributes the conditioned air through 
the building and returns it to the AHU.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,140
The operation of an AHU is illustrated 
in a schematic in Figure 1.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,600
You can relate this schematic to the key parts of 
an actual AHU in this mechanical room in Figure 2.

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,840
Let’s start with the cold outside 
air on the left of the schematic.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,820
Air handling units collect air from outside, which 
is treated and distributed throughout the rooms.

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,900
They also recycle part of the returned 
air from indoors and mix it with the  

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,120
outside air in the mixing chamber to save energy.

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Mixed air then flows through filters.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,380
Depending on the air purity requirements, 
the filter applied will have a higher or  

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,300
lower particle, virus, bacteria, odor, and
other air pollutants retention levels.

22
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,520
During the COVID-19 pandemic, filters 
in an HVAC's air handling unit are a  

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,000
first line of defense in removing 
virus germs from recirculated air.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,180
The conservation principle 
applied to the mixing chamber is 

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,740
illustrated in Figure 3.

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,640
After filtration, air flows through heating 
and cooling coils where it is either heated  

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,080
up or cooled down to meet the required indoor 
temperature for both comfort and efficiency.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,180
Heating and cooling coils are heat exchangers that
transfer temperature between steam and air in the  

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,200
case of the heating coil and between chilled 
water and air in the case of the cooling coil.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,260
The humidifier and dehumidifier are optional parts  

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,160
of an AHU if humidity control 
of the indoor air is desired.

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,140
The conservation principle applied to the heating 
and cooling coils is illustrated in Figure 4.

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,440
The supply fan is on the 
far right of the schematic.

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
It is an electromechanical system that 
powers the air to expel it from the  

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
AHU to the ducts that distribute 
the air throughout the library.
