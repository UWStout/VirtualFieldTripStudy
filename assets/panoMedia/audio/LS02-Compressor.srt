00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Compressors and fans are essentially the 
same devices. However, compressors are  

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,740
capable of compressing gas at very high pressures.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,720
Compressed air at the heating plant finds 
application in operating pneumatic instruments  

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,420
connected with boilers, fans, valves, 
actuators, motors, and control systems.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,040
The air system in the Plant is divided 
into instrument air and service air.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,880
As the name suggests, instrument 
air is used to operate pneumatic  

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,700
instruments where the quality of 
the air is extremely important.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,760
All control valves, pneumatic dampers, gates,  

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,860
guide vanes, and solenoid valves operate using 
instrument air, which is dry compressed air.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,960
Figure 1 is the compressor system.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,700
It can produce instrument air at 
a rate of up to 125 cubic feet per  

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,720
minute and at the pressure range of 90 to 110 psi.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,600
Service air is required for 
cleaning and purging of filters,  

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,380
and it is compressed air directly 
coming out of the compressor (Figure 2).

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,880
Its quality requirements are not as stringent 
as those of instrument air, therefore,  

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,460
there is no need to have air
dryer for service air.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,500
Compressors, as well as pumps and fans, are 
devices to increase the pressure of a fluid.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,700
Work is supplied to these devices from an 
external source through a rotating shaft.

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,400
Therefore, compressors involve work inputs.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,360
If we neglect the changes in kinetic 
and potential energies the steady-state,  

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,640
steady-flow first law of the conservation of 
energy equation will look like this in Figure 3.
