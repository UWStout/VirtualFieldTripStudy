00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
We are standing in front of Combustion 
Air Fan 3 on the basement floor.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,060
A fan is an air pump: a machine that creates 
a pressure difference and causes airflow.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,180
The impeller imparts to the 
air static and kinetic energy,  

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,940
which varies in proportion, 
depending on the type of fan.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,480
Fans are classified as centrifugal or axial flow  

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,300
fans according to the direction 
of airflow through the impeller.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,380
The general configuration of a 
centrifugal fan is shown in Figure 1.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,140
A typical application of centrifugal fans at UW 
Stout’s central heating plant involves combustion  

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,640
air blowers that provide air at the right 
temperature and pressure to the boilers’ burners.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,900
A general configuration of an axial 
flow fan is shown in Figure 2.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,760
A typical application of axial fans at 
UW Stout’s central chiller plant involves  

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,140
electric fans within cooling towers that 
create airflows and remove heat from warm  

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,860
condenser
water.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,580
Except for Boiler 1, which has its 
combustion air blower attached to  

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,520
the unit on the main floor, three 
other boilers have their combustion  

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,040
air blowers located on the
basement floor of the plant.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,260
Figure 3 illustrates Fan 3’s Station supplying
combustion air to Boiler 3 above.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,740
Fan 3 is a centrifugal fan driven by an electric
motor.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,320
The motor’s speed and torque are controlled  

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,000
by an electronic device called a 
Variable Frequency Drive or VFD.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,860
The VFD controls the fan's output depending 
on the amount of air demanded by the boiler.

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,060
Fan 3 also has an Inlet Vane Damper 
to control the low flow at a very  

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,400
low load during the start and closing burner.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,280
A fan damper is similar to air vents in your car.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,460
You can open or close louvers 
to adjust the airflow;  

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,880
Increase by opening the damper 
and decrease by closing it.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,220
The fan and motor speeds remain constant.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,460
The Inlet Vane Damper is installed 
on the fan's inlet and swirls the  

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,300
inlet air in the same direction as the 
fan rotation to alter fan performance.

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,200
They are commonly modulated with 
electric or pneumatic actuators.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:10,259
Working together with VFD, the 
Inlet Vane Damper can help Fan  

32
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,720
3 be more responsive on load reduction control.

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,100
The centrifugal fan often generates 
noise from the inlet during operation.

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,600
This noise is loud and considered an 
occupational hazard because loud noise  

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,920
can create physical and psychological 
stress, reduce productivity, interfere  

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,580
with communication and concentration, 
and contribute to workplace accidents.

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,240
A silencer duct was installed to 
reduce noise at the fan inlet.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,160
In Thermodynamics, fans are considered 
shaft work machines whose primary  

39
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,880
function is to promote a work input 
or output through a rotating shaft.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,920
Shaft work machines are steady-state, 
single-inlet single-outlet open systems.

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
The work produced or absorbed 
by fans can then be determined  

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,280
from the energy rate balance 
equation, as seen in Figure 4.
