00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,200
A heat exchanger typically involves two flowing 
fluids separated by a solid wall of a metal tube.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,960
For the condenser, the first fluid is hot 
refrigerant entering the condenser shell from the  

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,340
compressor, and the second fluid is the condenser 
water entering the tube from the cooling tower.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,280
The pumps causing the condenser 
water to flow across the 

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,760
tubes are located outside the chiller 
on the second floor of this plant.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,020
To control the growth of slime, 
which is organic bacteria and algae,  

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,980
that can significantly reduce the efficiency 
of cooling by reducing heat transfer,  

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,240
oxidizing biocide like bromine 
are fed in the condenser water.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,060
For the evaporator, the first fluid 
is cold liquid refrigerant entering  

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,940
the evaporator shell from the 
expansion valve and the second  

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,240
fluid is the return chilled water 
entering the tube from the buildings.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,800
The pumps causing the chilled water to flow across 
the tubes are on the basement floor of this plant.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,820
Heat is first transferred from the hot 
fluid to the tube wall by convection,  

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,500
through the wall by conduction, and from the 
wall to the cold fluid again by convection.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,940
Any radiation effects are usually included 
in the convection heat transfer coefficients.

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,300
Heat exchangers are normally 
well-insulated devices that  

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,380
allow energy exchange between hot and 
cold fluids without mixing the fluids.
