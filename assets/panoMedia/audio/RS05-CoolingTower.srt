00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Cooling towers are large evaporative cooling 
systems that can be used to reject heat from  

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,480
a warm condenser water to the atmosphere 
by a combination of heat and mass transfer.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,760
Cooling towers can operate by natural or forced 
convection. Also, they may be counter-flow,  

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,520
cross-flow, or a combination of these.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,640
Figure 1 is a cutaway picture 
of a forced convection,  

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,660
cross-flow cooling tower and Figure 
2 shows its working principle.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,240
The cooling tower contains a large fan 
which blows air through the unit. The  

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,920
warm condenser water about to be cooled enters 
at 1 and is sprayed from the top of the tower.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,400
The falling water usually passes 
through the fill media intended  

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,520
to keep it broken up into fine 
drops to promote evaporation.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,360
Atmospheric air drawn in at 
3 by the fan flows upward,  

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,620
counter to the direction of the falling 
water droplets. As the two streams interact,  

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,580
a fraction of the entering liquid water 
stream evaporates into the moist air,

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,140
which exits at 4 with a greater humidity 
ratio than the incoming moist air at 3,  

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,700
while liquid water exits at 2 with a lower 
temperature than the water entering at 1.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,480
Since some of the incoming water is 
evaporated into the moist air stream,  

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,320
an equivalent amount of makeup water 
is added at 5 so that the return mass  

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
flow rate of the cool water equals the mass 
flow rate of the warm water entering at 1.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,760
For operation at a steady state, mass balances 
for the dry air, and water and an energy balance  

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,560
on the overall cooling tower, provide information 
about the cooling tower performance. In applying  

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,400
the energy balance, heat transfer with 
the surroundings is usually neglected.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,320
The power input to the fan of forced-convection 
towers also may be negligible relative to other  

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,120
energy rates involved. The example that follows 
illustrates the analysis of a cooling tower  

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,160
using conservation of mass and energy together 
with property data for the dry air and water.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,580
Each cooling tower can typically cool 
2,400 gallons (about 9,084.98 L) per  

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,540
minute of water from 95°F to 85°F at 
72°F ambient wet bulb temperature.
