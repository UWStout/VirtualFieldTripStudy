00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Here we are on the mezzanine of the 
heating plant and these two big green tanks 

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,240
are deaerators. A deaerator is a device 
that is widely used for the removal of air 

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,200
and other dissolved gases from the 
feedwater to steam generating boilers. 

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,540
Specifically, dissolved oxygen in boiler 
feed waters will cause serious corrosion 

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,500
damage in steam systems by attaching 
to the walls of metal piping and other 

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,760
metallic equipment and forming oxides 
or rust. It also combines with any 

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,440
dissolved carbon dioxide to form carbonic 
acid, which causes further corrosion. 

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,140
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a 
tray-type deaerator. It has a vertical domed 

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,460
deaeration section mounted above a 
horizontal boiler feedwater storage vessel. 

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,260
Boiler feedwater enters the vertical 
dearation section above the perforated trays 

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,700
and flows downward through the 
perforations. Low-pressure dearation steam 

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,660
enters below the perforated trays and 
flows upward through the perforations. 

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,280
The perforated trays provide good contact 
and mixing between the steam and the 

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,780
boiler feed water. The steam strips 
dissolved gas from the boiler feedwater and 

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,640
exits via the vent at the top of the 
domed section. The deaerated water flows 

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,600
down into the horizontal storage vessel 
from which it is pumped to the steam 

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,160
generating boiler system. External insulation 
of the vessel is typically provided to 

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,240
minimize heat loss.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Deaerators provide many benefits 
to the boiler system, including: 

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,320
Serving as a surge collection tank 
for process condensate return. 

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,560
Blending hot return condensate 
and cold makeup water. 

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,120
Preheating feedwater uniformly 
to improve boiler efficiency, and 

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,640
Removing oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide 
(CO2) from feedwater to mitigate 

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,240
corrosion. 

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,660
Most deaerators are American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers- (ASME-) certified 

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,520
pressure vessels that operate at 5 to 
15 psig and at a water temperature of 

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,380
225°Fahrenheit, which is the minimum 
temperature required to remove dissolved 

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,240
O2 and CO2 from feedwater. A deaerator 
is not only an essential auxiliary 

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,980
component of a reliable feedwater system, 
but the heart of a boiler mass-flow 

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,240
and thermal-energy database that can be 
used to critique plant operations and 

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,100
identify energy-savings opportunities.
