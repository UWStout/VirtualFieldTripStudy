00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
The boiler is considered the heart 
of a central heating system where  

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,440
it generates high-pressure steam and 
sends it to buildings around campus.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,900
Boiler 4 is an O-type water-tube boiler 
produced by Cleaver-Brooks and was put  

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,540
into operation in 1973. It can generate 
about 90,000 pounds of saturated steam  

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,080
per hour at a pressure of 114.7 PSI and 
a temperature of 338 degrees Fahrenheit.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,800
This section will explain how steam 
is generated inside the boiler.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,380
Water-tube boilers are designed to 
circulate hot combustion gases from the

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,740
burner around the outside of a 
large number of water-filled tubes.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,260
As the flue gas passes through the tubes, it heats 
the tubes, which then heats the water. When water  

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,180
is heated in the boiler at atmospheric pressure, 
the water temperature increases until the boiling  

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,460
point or saturated temperature, and the volume of 
water increases slightly. Once the water reaches  

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,880
saturation temperature (the temperature 
at which it will boil at that pressure),  

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,860
the water temperature remains there even 
if heat is added. The heat added does  

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,000
not increase the water temperature, but the 
water gets converted from liquid into steam.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,780
Bubbles of steam are produced and 
rise to the steam drum on the top  

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,840
of the boiler. These bubbles 
burst and release steam into  

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,200
the space above the steam drum and 
are ready to enter the steam system.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,200
The saturated temperature of steam varies 
with the boiler pressure at which water is  

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,260
heated. The saturated temperature 
rises when pressure is increased,  

20
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,260
and the temperature goes down 
when pressure is decreased.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,080
For example, the saturated temperature of the 
steam is 212 degrees Fahrenheit at the atmospheric  

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,140
pressure of 14.7 psi. This state of steam is 
represented by point A on a diagram called the  

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,680
Liquid-vapor saturation curve of water. Inside the 
boiler, where the pressure is set at 114.7 psi,  

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,840
the temperature of saturated steam increases 
to 338 degrees Fahrenheit at point B.
