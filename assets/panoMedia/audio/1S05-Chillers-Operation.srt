00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
All chillers at the Central Cooling 
Plant are YORK MaxE chillers, Model YK.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,620
Each chiller produces a cooling capacity 
of 800 tons using refrigerant R134a.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,920
The chiller consists of an open 
motor mounted to a compressor,  

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,120
condenser, evaporator, and variable 
flow control or expansion valve.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,060
The chiller is controlled by the Microcomputer 
Control Center that monitors its operation. The  

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,340
operating status, temperatures, pressures, and 
other information pertinent to operation of the  

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,400
chiller are automatically displayed 
and read on the graphic display.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,800
Let’s look at the water-cooled chiller 
and its diagram in the inserted pictures:

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,500
In operation, water at 54 degrees Fahrenheit from 
the primary circuit flows through the evaporator,  

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,660
where boiling refrigerant absorbs heat, making 
it become chilled water at 44 degrees Fahrenheit.  

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,300
The chilled water is then piped through a 
secondary circuit to buildings around campus.

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,440
From here, it flows through fan coil 
units or other air conditioning units,  

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,560
absorbing heat from the air at 
terminal buildings. The warmed  

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,740
water is then returned to the chiller 
to complete the chilled water circuit.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,260
The refrigerant vapor, which is produced 
by the boiling action in the evaporator,  

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,860
flows to the compressor where a 
rotating impeller increases its  

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,680
pressure and temperature, then 
discharges into the condenser.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,800
Condenser water at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit 
flows through the condenser tubes absorbing heat  

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,180
from the hot refrigerant vapor. This causes 
the refrigerant to condense. After the heat  

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,460
absorption process, the condenser water becomes 
warmer, at around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. It is  

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,780
then pumped into a cooling tower where it yields 
the most heat energy to the fast-moving air inside  

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,640
the tower. Afterward, the water flows back to the 
condenser to complete the condenser water circuit.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Meanwhile, the condensed refrigerant drains 
from the condenser into the liquid return line,  

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,480
where a variable orifice meters the flow of liquid  

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,960
refrigerant to the evaporator. This 
completes the refrigerant circuit.
