1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Here we are in the central control room where the 
boiler operators monitor and control the boilers.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,920
This state-of-the-art control 
system has been implemented  

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,600
since 2021 using PLC technology and 
a system of cameras and sensors.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,200
These interactive screens like the 
one you see in Picture 1 are touch  

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,560
screen Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) displays.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,240
They give the boiler operator an overview of 
the entire operation of the system in real time,  

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,040
including states and measurements 
of air, water, steam, and fuel.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,480
They also make the control and operation 
of devices around the plant such as valves,  

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,760
sensors, pumps, and motors more accurate, 
efficient, reliable, and user-friendly.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,060
These direct interactions are made 
through a computerized automatic  

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,980
system called Supervisory Control and 
Data Acquisition or SCADA for short.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,780
The SCADA system consists of software and 
hardware elements that allow the operators  

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,680
to control steam-producing processes 
locally or at a remote location;

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,200
monitor, gather, and process real-time 
data, and record events into a log file.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,720
The SCADA software processes, distributes, 
and displays the data, helping operators and  

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,800
facility management personnels analyze 
the data and make important decisions.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,960
Picture 1 gives you an overview of Boiler 2, which 
is hundreds of feet away from this control room.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,340
We can also see this same screen in front 
of Boiler 2 on the main plant ground floor.

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,700
Here is our combustion chamber 
with two burners running.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,880
The boiler is making 19.4-kilo pounds of 
steam per hour at a pressure of 98.3 PSIG.

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,640
The number 22.8 kSCFH along the yellow 
pipe on this screen suggests that the  

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,160
boiler uses 22.8 kilos standard cubic feet 
of natural gas per hour for its burners.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,120
Also, the silver pipe at the bottom 
indicates that the boiler is taking  

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,800
4,457 standard cubic feet of supply air at 60.4 
degrees Fahrenheit for the combustion process.

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,000
Picture 2 here just tells us the steam 
trends, how much steam flow the boilers make,  

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,160
and what the water level inside the boiler 
is on a real-time or hourly and daily basis.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,160
There are two teams of three 
staff staying here 24/7.

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,500
The boiler operator is responsible for the entire 
shift and will report to the superintendent.

29
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,600
Together, they are in charge of the shift,  

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,840
making all the decisions for all 
operations in the heating plant.
