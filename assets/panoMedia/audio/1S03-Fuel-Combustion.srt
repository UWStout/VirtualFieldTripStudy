1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,500
Boilers rely on the combustion process of
fuel to provide the heat required to produce

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,620
steam inside the boiler.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,059
Fuel contains some basic elements like carbon,
hydrogen, and sulfur.

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,009
Inside the boiler’s combustion chamber,
these elements react with oxygen and nitrogen

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,760
from the supplied air to
generate heat and form carbon dioxide, nitrogen

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,430
oxides, sulfur dioxides, and water vapor.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,949
Two types of fuel sources are used at the
Central Heating Plant: natural gas and low-sulfur

8
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,590
diesel fuel oil.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,520
Natural gas emits about 28% less carbon dioxide
and three times less nitrogen oxides than

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,590
fuel oil.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,130
The Plant uses natural gas as the primary
fuel to reduce campus pollution emissions,

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,710
operations,
and maintenance costs.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,110
Fuel oil is only used as a backup fuel source.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,649
Fuel Valve Train.

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,720
In burner combustion systems, the gas valve
train, also known as the fuel valve train,

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,600
as seen in Figure 1, is the mechanical assembly
that introduces and interrupts fuel supply

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
to the burner.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,370
The gas valve train helps ensure the boiler
operates safely by starting or stopping the

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,479
fuel flow into the
system.

20
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,000
It both monitors and regulates fuel pressure
within the system.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,820
The gas valve train consists of multiple components
mounted on a steel rack, including pressure

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:27,300
regulating valves, fuel oil flow control and
metering devices, and safety shut-off valves. Combustion Efficiency.

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,119
The quantity of heat generated by the complete
combustion of a unit of a specific fuel is

24
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,119
constant and is termed the “heating value”
or “heat of combustion” of that fuel.

25
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,270
The efficiency of a boiler that involves the
combustion of a fuel is based on the heating

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,689
value of the fuel, which is the amount of
heat released when a unit amount of fuel at

27
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,500
room temperature is completely burned and
the combustion products are cooled to the

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
room temperature.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,840
Then, the boiler performance can be characterized
by combustion efficiency as seen in the formulas

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,250
in Figure 2.

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,200
Most fuels contain hydrogen, which forms water
when burned, and the heating value of a fuel

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,030
will be different depending on whether the
water in combustion products is in liquid

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,449
or vapor form.

34
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,530
The heating value is called “lower heating
value”, or LHV, when the water in the combustion

35
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,220
gases is a vapor, and “higher heating value”,
or HHV, when the water in the combustion gases

36
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,230
is completely condensed, and thus the heat
of vaporization is also recovered.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,750
The LHV is often used as the measure of energy
per kg of fuel supplied to the gas or gas

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,300
turbine engine because the exhaust gases have
such a high temperature that the water formed

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:43,940
is a vapor as it leaves the engine with other
combustion products.

40
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,900
The HHV is often used as the measure of energy
per kilogram of fuel supplied to the steam

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,659
power cycle because there are heat transfer
processes within the cycle that absorb enough

42
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,019
energy from the products of combustion that
some of the water vapor formed during combustion

43
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,220
will condense.
