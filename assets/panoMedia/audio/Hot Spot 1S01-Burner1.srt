00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,080
Boilers rely on the combustion 
process of fuel to provide the  

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,360
heat required to produce steam inside the boiler.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,820
A burner is a group of devices that introduce 
Fuel and air into a furnace, mix them together,  

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,200
and provide a platform for combustion 
with the assistance of an ignition device.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,060
The burner incorporates a blower that 
supplies combustion air at a high pressure,  

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,540
enough to compensate for the airflow resistance 
inside the boiler. Like all burners in the plant,  

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,420
this burner uses natural gas as its primary 
fuel and fuel oil as an auxiliary support fuel.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,980
Atomization breaks liquid fuel oil into 
fine particles when admitted into the  

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,720
furnace. Atomization is done mechanically 
by blowing air or steam into the burner.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,860
Fuel contains some basic elements like carbon, 
hydrogen, and sulfur. Inside the combustion  

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,540
chamber, these elements react with oxygen and 
nitrogen from the supplied air to liberate  

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,300
heat and form carbon dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, sulfur dioxides, and water vapor.

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,200
The university has used natural 
gas as its primary fuel for all  

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,340
boilers to reduce campus pollution 
emissions. Natural gas emits about  

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,620
50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal and 
28 percent less carbon dioxide than fuel oil.

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,940
The emission of nitrogen oxides is 
nearly five times less than burning  

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,400
coal and three times less than burning fuel oil.

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,280
Three types of heat transfer mechanisms occur 
during the combustion process inside the boiler:  

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,680
radiation, convection, and conduction. 
Each of these mechanisms transfers heat  

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,900
from the burning fuel to the water in the boiler  

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,860
where the combustion air temperature 
can go up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit
