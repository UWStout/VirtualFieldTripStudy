00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Attached to the heating plant is the central 
chiller plant that has been operating since 2007,  

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,220
consisting of three 800 ton chillers. These highly 
efficient, industrial-grade units, provide chilled  

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,379
water to 20 buildings on campus through over ten 
thousand feet of insulated underground piping.

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,160
The chilled supply water enters the 
building and flows through a heat exchanger,  

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,400
absorbing heat from the building 
space before recirculating back  

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,040
to the central plant through 
a closed loop return line.  

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,400
The central heating and chiller plants at UW Stout 
constitute an efficient way of air conditioning  

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,080
and heating the high-density building clusters 
on the campus called District Energy Systems.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,620
By delivering thermal energy directly in a usable 
form and combining loads for multiple buildings,  

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,140
District Energy Systems create economies of scale 
that drive efficiency and reduce energy costs.  

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,860
According to the United Nations Environment 
Program, known as the UNEP, District Energy  

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,960
Systems represent a best practice approach 
that can help cities, populated urban areas,  

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,200
and campuses "to move forward towards climate-resilient, 
resource-efficient, and low-carbon pathways."

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
Many equipment, processes, and systems in the 
heating and chiller plants are relevant resources  

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,080
for students in environmental science, applied 
science, engineering, and engineering technology.
