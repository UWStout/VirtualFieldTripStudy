1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Chemical treatment is used to control 
corrosion, scaling, biofouling,  

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,540
and biothreats. Minerals can cause a buildup of 
deposits and cause overheating of boiler parts.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,640
Corrosion weakens boiler metal by 
the thinning (removal) of the metal.  

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,680
Corrosion causes pitting and channeling of the 
metal, which results in the thinning of tubes,  

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,560
piping, and other boiler components. Corrosion is 
primarily caused by oxygen in the boiler water.  

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,640
Feedwater is treated to remove oxygen 
by heating and/or chemical treatment.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,180
De-aerators are used for removal of 
dissolved gases, especially oxygen and CO2.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,000
Heating the feedwater removes oxygen 
and carbon dioxide. Chemical treatment  

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,740
requires the addition of oxygen-scavenger 
chemicals. An oxygen scavenger chemical  

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,200
is a chemical that combines with oxygen to form 
harmless compounds for removal from the boiler.  

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,820
Sodium sulfite is an oxygen scavenger that 
is commonly used to treat boiler water.  

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,300
Sodium sulfite combines with oxygen to form sodium 
sulfate, which accumulates at the bottom of the  

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,460
boiler. The sodium sulfate is then discharged 
from the boiler through the bottom blowdown valve.
