00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Attached to the heating plant 
is the central chiller plant  

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,680
that has been operating since 2007, 
consisting of three 800 ton chillers.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,460
These high efficient, industrial-grade 
units produce a chilled water for supply  

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,300
to 16 buildings on the campus through 
an insulated underground piping network.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,460
The chilled supply water enters the 
building and flows through a heat exchanger,  

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,700
absorbing heat from the building 
space before recirculating back  

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,280
to the central plant through 
a closed-loop return line.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,220
The central heating and chiller plants at 
UW Stout constitute an efficient way of air  

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,900
conditioning and heating the high-density building 
clusters on campus called District Energy Systems.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,260
By delivering thermal energy directly in a usable 
form and combining loads for multiple buildings,  

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,900
District Energy Systems create economies of scale 
that drive efficiency and reduce energy costs.

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,380
According to the United Nations Environment 
Program, usually known as the UNEP for short,  

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,760
District Energy Systems represent a best 
practice approach that can help cities,  

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,260
populated urban areas, and campuses 
to move towards climate-resilient,  

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,020
resource-efficient, and low-carbon pathways.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,040
The equipment, processes, and systems in the 
heating and chiller plants are relevant resources  

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,260
for students in environmental science, applied 
science, engineering, and engineering technology.
