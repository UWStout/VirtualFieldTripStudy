00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,540
Boiler 2 and Boiler 3 in the next row are D-type 
water-tube boilers produced by Wickes Boiler  

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,420
in the 1960s as coal-fired boilers and have 
been producing steam at the plant since 1965.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,300
By March 4, 2020, the university made 
the switch to natural gas as the main  

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,200
fuel for all boilers at the plant to 
reduce campus emissions, operations,  

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,340
and maintenance
costs.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,400
According to the United States 
Energy Information Administration,  

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,460
burning natural gas emits about half of the carbon 
dioxide, or CO2, as burning coal. Using natural  

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,080
gas also helps eliminate equipment and labor 
cost for the coal and ash handling controls.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,620
Now, all boilers can use fuel 
oil as a backup fuel source.  

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,060
The tubes extend between an upper 
header, called a steam drum,

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,780
and a lower header, called a water 
drum or sometimes, a mud drum.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,080
Tubes are either straight or bent 
into simple or complex shapes.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,500
Water-tube boilers are designed to circulate hot 
combustion gases or flue gas around the outside  

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,880
of a large number of water-filled tubes. 
As the flue gas passes through the tubes,  

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,340
it heats the tubes, which then heats the water.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,000
As more heat is transferred, the water 
temperature keeps rising until it  

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,220
reaches the saturation temperature and water 
changes phase from liquid to vapor or steam.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,100
The temperature of saturated steam rises when 
pressure is increased, and the temperature goes  

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,920
down when pressure is decreased. For example, 
the temperature of saturated steam is212 degrees  

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,960
Fahrenheit at the atmospheric pressure 
of zero pounds per square inch, or PSI.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,400
However, inside the boiler where 
the pressure is set at 100 PSI,  

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,840
the temperature of saturated steam 
increases to 338 degrees Fahrenheit.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,660
A plot showing this relationship is known in 
Thermodynamics as liquid-vapor saturation curve.  

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,440
Boiler 2 can produce 25,000 pounds of 
steam per hour at the pressure of 100 PSI,  

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,220
and temperature of 338 degrees 
Fahrenheit. This steam is sent  

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,160
out to the buildings on campus 
through underground piping systems.
