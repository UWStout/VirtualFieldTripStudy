00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,280
The underground piping network system 
distributes steam and chilled water 

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,880
generated from the Plant to buildings 
around the campus to serve their heating 

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,240
and cooling needs. Underground 
systems are used because of their  

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,720
aesthetics and safety
issues. They are closed-loop systems.  

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,400
That means that steam is generated at the
Plant, sent via underground pipes to the  

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,960
buildings to be used, then the steam is
condensed back to water which is then pumped  

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
back to the Plant to be reused. This
network also includes the underground  

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,940
piping system that collects warmed water
after chilled water has been used at the  

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
buildings. The steam piping system is about
5 miles in length and serves 51 buildings  

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,820
across campus, while the chilled water
piping system is about two miles long  

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,420
and serves 20 buildings, mainly on South
Campus. Several buildings contain old steam  

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,180
and condensate pipes installed in 1916 and still
have insulation with asbestos, which are buried  

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,440
underground. Significant parts of
the steam and condensate system are  

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,880
pre-insulated cast iron pipes running in
concrete surface trenches or deep-buried  

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,700
small tunnels. Steam pipe sizes vary from
2.5 to 10 inches and condensate pipes  

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,760
employ smaller sizes ranging from 1.5 to 5
inches. Heat transfer in buried systems is  

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,720
influenced by the thermal conductivity of
the soil and by the depth of burial,  

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,860
particularly when the system's thermal
insulation has a low thermal resistance.  

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,960
All directly buried underground chilled
water piping systems use 4-inch to 18-inch  

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,820
diameter HDPE pipes and can handle
working pressure up to 350 PSIG.
