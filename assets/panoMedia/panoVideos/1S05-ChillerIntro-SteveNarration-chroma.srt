1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,180
And we’re in our central chilled plant, 
which is attached to the heating plant.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,000
We have our 3, 800 ton York 
chillers in this plant, 

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,080
and I’m just going to kinda go through …

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:28,320
The plant was put in in 2007 so this is coming 
up on our 15th year of operation of this plant.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,120
I’ll kinda walk you through some of the 
piping that comes in and out of this chiller.

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,260
We’re gonna look at our flow 
through the condenser first. 

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,640
Up on the roof we have our cooling towers,  

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,740
and we come out of the basin of the 
cooling tower and go through a pump,

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,720
And that pumps the water down 
through this pipe right here  

10
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,100
and it comes in to the bottom 
of the condenser on the chiller.

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,040
Now there’s a divider plate in this 
green box on the end of the chiller  

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,800
so the waters going through the 
lower half of that condenser,

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:21,300
it makes a turn on the end of the condenser 
and comes back through and then it comes  

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,060
through this pipe over here and heads to the 
top of the cooling tower that’s on the roof.

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,320
And once it gets there it 
goes through a distribution  

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,660
system that directs the water down through 
nozzles and breaks the water up into  

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,920
smaller droplets that drop down 
through the fill in the tower,

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,020
and we have a fan that induces a draft 
in that tower, where it sucks air in, and  

19
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:03,060
that helps cool the water droplets off
and they fall into the basin on the bottom  

20
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,020
of the cooling tower and collect 
and the cycle starts over again.
