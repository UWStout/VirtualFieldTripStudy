00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,300
The heating plant at U.W. Stout was 
built in 1965. It was designed to  

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,640
supply the entire campus with steam 
for heating, hot water, and cooking.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,740
We have a closed-loop system. Steam 
is generated at the heating plant  

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,560
and sent in underground pipes to the buildings.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,040
After use, the steam is condensed into water  

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,300
and pumped back to the plant 
where it can be used again.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,720
The original plant had 3 boilers.  

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,980
Two burned coal and natural gas. The other boiler 
was converted to burn natural gas and fuel oil.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,600
In 1972 the plant was expanded, 
and a fourth boiler was added.  

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,560
The boiler burned natural gas as well as fuel oil.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,740
All four boilers are water tube boilers.  

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,100
This means the water is inside the tubes, 
and this is where it is converted to steam.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,340
In 2005 the oldest boiler was 
replaced with a newer, larger one.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,860
The new boiler is more efficient and built 
with its own stack making it more versatile.

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,940
Originally, the plant had pneumatic controls.  

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:20,520
In 2000 the plant was converted to electronic 
controls, and in 2021 the controls were converted  

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,540
to Program Logic Controllers, or PLC’s. These 
are more accurate, efficient, and user-friendly.

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,740
There have been many upgrades to the plant. 
All boiler feed pumps, condensate pumps,  

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,100
and forced draft fans now are equipped 
with Variable Frequency Drives, or VFD’s.  

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,420
We have also one turbine-driven boiler feed pump.

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,960
In 2020 and 21 we added a 42,000-gallon fuel oil  

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,980
tank to ensure a reliable fuel supply and 
removed all boiler coal-burning equipment.

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,800
All four boilers are now capable of 
burning fuel oil and natural gas.

24
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,380
The plant is operated and staffed 
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,280
We have six power plant operators and 
two power plant superintendents on staff.
