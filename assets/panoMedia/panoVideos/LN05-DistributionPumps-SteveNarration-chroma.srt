1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,200
Right now we’re in our lower 
level of our chilled plant.  

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,600
This device right here is our air separator.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,180
The return line from our secondary loop,  

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,720
which feeds the buildings and 
air handlers in those buildings,  

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,720
comes back and any air that is entrained in the 
water is separated out in this air separator.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,180
Then what it does is it comes across  

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:46,260
and we go into our primary chilled water pumps 
which take off of this header and increase the  

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,540
pressure on that water and force it to go 
up through the evaporator on the chiller.

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:04,560
And then that water, after it goes through the 
evaporator, returns back down and comes back  

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:15,480
around and goes into a header for our secondary 
loop pumps which pump the water around campus.

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:25,080
And that’s these three pumps on this side over 
here, and they are 150 HP … motors on these pumps,  

12
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:34,260
and its more redundant capacity there, we don’t 
really need it. Generally, we run with just one  

13
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,140
secondary loop pump at a time.

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:52,560
And, those are on variable frequency drives. 
So, we control our flow that we have going out  

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:02,700
in that secondary loop. We maintain a 10 PSI 
differential between our supply and return lines.
