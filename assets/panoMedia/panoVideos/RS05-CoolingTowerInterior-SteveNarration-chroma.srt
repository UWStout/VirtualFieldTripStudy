00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,540
This is our cooling tower, or one of our 
cooling towers, in the roof of the chill plant.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,760
And what we’re looking at is our 
inducer fan which induces a draft.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,840
it’s a pretty fan with a lot of blades on it!

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,100
You can see the belt drive and 
that’s on a frequency drive so  

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,300
depending on how much cooling we need 
that fan will speed up or slow down.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,040
That’s all based off our water temp 
leaving the basin and going to the chiller.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,340
And the black material here 
is what they call fill,  

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,400
and the water droplets are 
dropping down through that fill,

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,660
and then we’re bringing air from 
outside the cooling tower with  

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,960
this fan and pushing the exhaust air up 
through the top of the cooling tower.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,300
Yeah, normally we’d have water if we were 
up and running, we’d have this filled,  

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:08,340
and we’d have about 18 inches of water 
in this sump when the chillers off.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,000
When it’s running and the pumps running, 
the water level drops about 4 inches and  

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,920
that’s mostly water that’s falling down through 
the fill, that's where it goes at that time.
