00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,280
We’re in the Mezz of the 
chilled plant. Up on this level,  

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,900
we have our three … condenser water pumps up here.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:21,960
We have a bromine feeder which we feed bromine 
into our cooling tower water to prevent Legionella  

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,260
bacteria growing in the towers. Very important!

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:39,540
And we also have our switch gear up here. We 
have our 4160v main disconnects for our chiller,  

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,420
these three disconnects here.
And then over here we have  

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,660
our motor starters, and our chiller 
motors are a reduced voltage start.

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:00,880
Gives them a little chance to get going 
without creating too much stress on them.

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,800
And over in this area, we 
have our disconnects for our  

10
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,420
pumps that are in the basement for our chilled 
water, primary pumps, and then also our  

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,900
oil freq drives on the chiller that vary the 
oil pressure with the chiller compressor.
