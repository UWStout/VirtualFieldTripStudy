1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,980
We’re in the basement of our chilled plant 
and what we’re looking at here is our supply  

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,380
line right here going out that feeds the loop 
around campus (the secondary chilled water loop).

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,040
And that goes to the air handlers  

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:29,100
in the buildings around campus to provide the 45 
deg water for the cooling coils in those areas.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:36,480
And over here is our return 
line that brings the 55 deg  

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:45,360
water back to our chilled plant to be 
cooled down again to 45 deg and sent out.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,620
Right over here, the first piece of 
equipment we go through is a air separator.  

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,800
So, if we have any air in that chilled water 
returning that’s where we take it out at.

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:11,040
We also add some water treatment into 
the secondary chilled water loop just  

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,952
to prevent corrosion on the inside 
of our piping; to protect our piping.

11
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:27,840
And over here we have a sand filter. And 
what that does is it will pick up any  

12
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:36,240
small particulate, or small fine 
pieces of rust, it filters it out.  

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,580
And then when this backflushes it 
will flush that down the drain.

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,460
This piece of equipment here, when it 
backflushes, it goes through 600 gallons of water  

15
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,955
per backflush cycle. And that 
goes once a day, it backflushes.
