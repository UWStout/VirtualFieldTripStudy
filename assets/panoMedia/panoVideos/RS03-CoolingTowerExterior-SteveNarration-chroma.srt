00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,440
We’re on the roof of the chilled plant, and 
what we have behind me is the cooling towers,  

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,780
starting on the north that’s #1, #2 in 
the middle, and #3 on the south here.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,880
Our water comes from the basin of the cooling 
tower flows through the condenser water pumps  

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,860
which were in the Mezz just down below here, 
and the pressure is increased on that water.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,800
It’s pumped down through the condenser and is 
brought back up through the piping here, back  

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,560
up to the top of the cooling tower where 
it goes through some distributor nozzles.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,360
That water’s broken up,  

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,800
and it drops down through the 
fill area, and we have a fan up  

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
on top of this cooling tower that induces a draft.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,620
And that draft cools that water down  

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,460
about 10 deg before it returns to the sump 
and is pumped around to the chiller again.
