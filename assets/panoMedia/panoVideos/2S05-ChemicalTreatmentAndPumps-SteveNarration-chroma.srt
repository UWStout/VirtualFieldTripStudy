1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:10,560
Right now, we’re in the Mezz of the chilled plant 
and what we do on this level is we add chemical  

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,900
to our tower water.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:23,640
We have a chem meter right here that … senses 
the amount of mineral that we have in the water  

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,720
and then it operates a blow-down valve and 
reduces that amount of mineral in the water.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,220
We do that so we don’t foul our 
condenser tubes on the chillers.

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:46,200
Our pumps here are 60 HP apiece on these pumps and 
it takes the water out of the basin of the cooling  

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,380
tower, comes down to the inlet of the pump, 
and it increases the pressure of that water,

8
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:03,240
And that water goes down to the bottom pass of 
the condenser and returns back and goes to the  

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,260
top of the cooling tower where that water is 
sent through the cooling tower to cool it off.

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:20,880
Generally, we kinda go … like to see the 
water come back at like 75 deg, 70 deg,  

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,020
and then we add about 10 deg to that 
when it goes through the condenser.

12
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,320
For efficiency, the lower you bring 
that temperature back the more  

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,280
efficient that chiller will be. But 
if you get a day that’s really hot,  

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,140
and a lot of humidity, you don’t 
get a very good heat transfer.

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:55,620
It's hard to remove heat and humidity in 
the water with air that is really humid.

16
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,400
In those cases, we have to throttle 
back our chillers at a reduced capacity.

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,300
And our power fans are 
controlled with frequency drives  

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,800
and those are right here. We have three 
of those, one for each cooling tower.

19
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:24,420
Our pumps for the condensers they're 
a solid, they’re a steady-flow pump.  

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,580
We need that to provide a steady flow 
of water through those condensers.
