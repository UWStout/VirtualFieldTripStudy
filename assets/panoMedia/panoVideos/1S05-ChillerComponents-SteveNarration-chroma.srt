00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,420
Okay, our components of the chiller, 
you’re going to have the condenser,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,580
you’re going to have an evaporator, we have 
a drive motor, a centrifugal compressor,

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,100
so basically, our water flow 
is coming down, and it's…

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,580
In this condenser, we have a lot of tubes.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,800
There's, I believe it’s over 
1000 tubes in the condenser.

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,860
The water’s coming through the condenser  

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,500
and then going back up to the 
cooling tower, and that takes the

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,840
super-heated discharge  

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,420
gas coming off the compressor and cools it down 
and changes that vapor to a liquid refrigerant.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,000
There’s a lot of tubes in that condenser!
