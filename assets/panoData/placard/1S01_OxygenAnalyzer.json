    "description": "It is used to monitor and control the oxygen concentration in combustion gases in boilers. With this analyzer, the operator can acquire a continuous measurement of oxygen levels to detect combustion failures. Too little oxygen results in incomplete combustion creating harmful emissions. Setting the boiler to burn with excess oxygen is the normal solution to reducing emissions."
