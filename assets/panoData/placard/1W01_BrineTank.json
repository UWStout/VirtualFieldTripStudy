    "description": "The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt or, sometimes, potassium to restore the resin beadsâ€™ positive charge. Softener salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank."
