    "title": "Triple Duty Valve",
    "description": "The triple duty valve combines three different types of valves on the discharge side of condenser water pump into one, a shut-off valve, check valve, and balancing valve. The shut-off valve allows isolation of the pump from the rest of the system, the check valve prevents backflow by only allowing the flow of fluids in one direction, and the balancing or throttling valve sets the flow rate of condenser water circuit."
