    "title": "Fuel Valve Train",
    "description": "In burner combustion systems, the gas valve train, also known as the fuel valve train, is the mechanical assembly that introduces and interrupts the supply of fuel to the burner. The gas valve train helps ensure the boiler operates safely by starting/stopping the flow of fuel into the system and monitoring/regulating the fuel pressure within the system. The gas valve train consists of multiple components mounted on a steel rack such as pressure regulating valves, fuel oil flow control and metering devices, and safety shut offs valves. Several codes standard such as NFPA, CSA and ASME publish requirements for the entire assemblies."
