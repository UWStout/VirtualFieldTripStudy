    "description": "These ash hoppers are remnants of the old coal-fired boiler system. On a coal-fired boiler like Boiler 2 and Boiler 3, ash hoppers are used to collect ash produced from the coal combustion process.  On March 4, 2020, the university switched to natural gas to comply with state regulation, reduce operation cost, and make the campus more sustainable."
